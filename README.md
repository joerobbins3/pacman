# Pacman Project

This project displays a combination of HTML and JS, and shows how I can use these two languages together in order to create dynamic, functional pages. 

## To Run: 

Download source files from repository to root folder, and then open [Index](https://github.com/joerobbins3/pacman/blob/main/index.html) in browser. 
Click on the pacman enemy to trigger movement.
Once triggered, he will begin to traverse the screen from left ot right.
Clicking more times will increase his velocity.
As he moves, he will change between two colors.
Once he hits the far right edge of viewport, he will change directions and begin to move from right to left.
He will also change the two colors he is toggling between.

## Future Improvements: 

I would love to have a more complicated track for pacman to run down, instead of just left to right.
